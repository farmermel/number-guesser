# Number Guesser


### About
Number Guesser is my first project as a student of front end software development at Turing school of software and design. I built it using vanilla javascript.

### Gameplay
The player is able to make guesses, receive feedback in real time, and set their own range. On win the range automatically expands by ten in each direction.

#### Special Surprise!
There is also a hitchikers guide to the galaxy related easter egg!
